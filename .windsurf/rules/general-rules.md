Always use this general rules:

# General Code Style & Formatting
- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid using any.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function or component.

# Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods (e.g., is_user).
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Use CONSTANT_CASE for constants.

# Project Structure & Architecture
- Follow Next.js patterns and use the App Router.
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js.

# TypeScript Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid any and enums; use explicit types and maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.
- Use top level src directory.
- Use path aliases for imports.
- Avoid relative imports
- Use 2 spaces for identing.
- Remove all console.log sentences.

# Syntax & Formatting
- Use the function keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use semicolons at EOL.
- Use Eslint and stylistic from .eslintrc.js

# Functions & Logic
- Avoid deeply nested blocks by:
  - Using early returns.
  - Extracting logic into utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce) to simplify logic.
- Use arrow functions for simple cases (<3 instructions), named functions otherwise.
- Use default parameter values instead of null/undefined checks.
- Use RO-RO (Receive Object, Return Object) for passing and returning multiple parameters.

# Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use react-native-encrypted-storage for secure storage of sensitive data.
- Ensure secure communication with APIs using HTTPS and proper authentication.
- Use Expo's Security guidelines to protect your app: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/security/

# Key Conventions
1. Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
2. The deployment to the web will be done using Railway for Next.js, and supabase.
